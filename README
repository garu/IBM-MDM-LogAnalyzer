This application was designed for a wide propose. You can run a script into MDM server 
machine and it will stream the performance.log into another machine and this machine will
process the log and also run the web server. It is good for avoid unnecessary CPU overhead.
Because you can see in real time the transactions. And sometimes, the MDM generate soo much
performance.log that you won't have space to keep all log in the file system. In a bank
the MDM log throughput was about 5GB/minute. So every minute the performance.log[1-10]
rotated and in the end of the day. We just had one minute performance.log.

[MDM Server] --streaming--> [Application Server]

You can also run both in the same machine, there is no problem about this. What usually happen is
that you get the performance.log from the costumer and analyze it offline into your on machine.

PUBLIC KEY TRUST LOGIN

Whatever how do you will use this, first you need automatic login using public key.

If you will run the collect log script into [MDM Server] run the follow commands into [MDM Server].
If you will run everything in same machie run the follow commands into this machine.

$ssh-keygen # press enter in all fields
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/hadoop/.ssh/id_rsa): 
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
Enter same passphrase again: 
Your identification has been saved in /home/hadoop/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /home/hadoop/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
55:73:43:90:ab:c9:4e:6e:a1:03:ff:cf:b9:a6:fd:77 hadoop@hadoop-virtual-machine
The key's randomart image is:
+--[ RSA 2048]----+
|            +++  |
|           ..o . |
|          .  .   |
|         .  .    |
|        S. o     |
|      .   *      |
|       o = .     |
|        + +o..  E|
|         +o+*o...|
+-----------------+

Now we will create public key relationship. Get the "~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub" from the machine that you will run
the collector script. Copy this and paste into [Application Server] "~/.ssh/authorized_keys"

If you are running everything in the same machine, you can do:
$cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub > ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

Now you can test:

$ssh youruser@appmachine

If don't ask password, is working.

CONFIGURATION

Go to "IBM-MDM-LogAnalyzer/script/load"

Open the file "script.sh" you need edit two variables HOME_PATH which is the directory of your folder
like "/home/hadoop/apps/IBM-MDM-LogAnalyzer" and DB2_HOME which is where your "sqllib" is.
This script is responsible to parse the performance.log and insert it into DB2.

open the file "streaming.sh" you need edit the variable LOCAL_MDM_DIR_LOGS which will be the place where the performance.log
are generated like "/opt/IBM/WebSphere/Profile/.../AppSrv01/logs" and the the variable REMOTE_SCRIPT_EXEC which will be the same
as HOME_PATH. Now you also need change your USERNAME and IPADDRESS.

Edit the file "IBM-MDM-LogAnalyzer-master/lib/IBM/MDM/LogAnalyzer/Model/DB.pm" and put your database informations.

BULK LOAD

Don't forget to configure the IBM-MDM-LogAnalyzer/script/load/sql/load.pl, you need set up your user name password and
your "IBM-MDM-LogAnalyzer/script/load/sql" folder.
