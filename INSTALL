# You need need a perl library called DBD::DB2 and this a binding 
# for DB2 ODBC. You need install a DB2 client and *you have to* select
# the option "Development Tool" during the DB2 client inslation
# check if you have hte folder "include" inside your DB2 installation
# /home/db2inst/sqllib/include

export DB2_HOME=<location where db2 is installed>
export DB2LIB=<location where db2 is installed>/lib[64/32]

$db2profile
$cpan DBD::DB2

# If you have troubles, please read:
# http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21297335

# After installing db2 client stuff and running the new db2profile comand if it still didnt work (cpan DBD::DB2) 
# copy the files sqlca.h  sqlcli.h  sqlenv.h  sql.h       sqlsystm.h sqlcli1.h  sqlda.h   sqlext.h  sqlstate.h
# from the folder "~/perl5" into the folder "db2/include"


# Now you need install all dependencies 

$cd IBM-MDM-LogAnalyzer-master
$perl Makefile.PL
$make

# You need create a database

db2 create database MDM_APP
db2 connect to MDM_APP user db2inst1 using db2inst1
db2 -tvf IBM-MDM-LogAnalyzer-master/data/db/create_table.sql

# Alter db2 user password in script/load/sql/load.sql
# and also in IBM-MDM-LogAnalyzer-master/lib/IBM/MDM/LogAnalyzer/Model/DB.pm
# you can test the stuffs running the server

$cd IBM-MDM-LogAnalyzer-master
$perl perl script/ibm_mdm_loganalyzer_server.pl

# And access from your browser: http://localhost:3000
